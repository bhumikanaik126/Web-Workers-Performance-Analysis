# ðŸ§µ Web Worker Performance Demo

This project demonstrates the difference between running heavy computations on the **main JavaScript thread** and in a **Web Worker**.  

It shows how Web Workers keep the UI responsive while handling CPU-intensive tasks like prime number calculation.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Run prime number calculations **on the main thread** (UI blocks, FPS drops).  
- Run the same calculation **in a Web Worker** (UI stays smooth).  
- **Progress bar** showing computation progress.  
- **FPS counter** to visualize UI responsiveness.  
- Execution time comparison.
